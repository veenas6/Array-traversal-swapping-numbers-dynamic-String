# Pointer Operations in C

## Overview
This C program demonstrates fundamental pointer operations including:

- Traversing an array using pointers
- Swapping two integers by passing pointers to a function
- Dynamic string manipulation using `malloc` and `realloc`

## Features

1. **Array Traversal using Pointers:**  
   Iterates through an integer array by incrementing a pointer and prints each element.

2. **Swapping Numbers using Pointers:**  
   Swaps the values of two integers by passing their addresses to a function.

3. **Dynamic String Manipulation:**  
   Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for strings using `malloc` and `realloc`, including string concatenation and memory cleanup.

## How to Use

### Compile the program
```bash
gcc -o pointer_ops pointer_ops.c
